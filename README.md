## Project Description

Assignments for Geoffrey Hinton's Neural Net Course on Coursera, translated from Matlab into Python.

* assignments 2-4 are quite different than what is presented in the course, as they were refactored into logical
classifiers (adapted from the sklearn framework).
* more work could certainly be done to remove redundancy between assignments, especially between 3 and 4.
* course can be found here: https://www.coursera.org/course/neuralnets
